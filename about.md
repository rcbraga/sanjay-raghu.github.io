Data science is blooming profession right now. ~~You might have read in some articles "Data science is the sexiest job ...".~~
 Articles nowadays is filled with lines like "Data Scientist: The Sexiest Job of the 21st Century" or "Data scientists: the highest paid professionals".
 So What does that means? Data science is attracting a lot of crowd, like myself a lot a people
want to become a data scientist. A large proportion of data scientist today is
 self taught without having masters or PhD degrees in the respective field. This have been possible because there is a lot of free online
 material are available and its growing day by day. data science have a large community which is very supportive.

 Learning things by yourself can be a bad experience, without proper help of mentors people get stuck at some point and leave
data science altogether.
In this blog I will be sharing my experience of learning data science as i go through it.
 In my opinion when you have already master something you generally forget the
problems and struggles you had when you were a beginner. Thats why I think it is more effective
 to share my experience along the way.
