Data science is blooming profession right now. You might have read in some articles "Data science is the sexiest job ...". So, like myself a lot a people
want to become a data scientist. A large proportion of data scientist today is self taught. This is been possible because there is a lot of free online
 material are available. Learning things by yourself can be a bad experience, without proper help of mentors people get stuck at some point and leave
data science altogether. data science have a large community which is very supportive and helping.

In this blog I will be sharing my experience of learning data science as i go through it. In my opinion when you master something you generally forget the
problems and struggles you had when you were a beginner. Thats why I think it is more effective to share my experience along tha way.
